	abstract = {In the Mediterranean region, patches of vegetation recovering from disturbance and transiently dominated by shrubs produce one of the world's most prized fungi, the black truffle (\textit{Tuber melanosporum}). In these successional plant communities, we have fragmentary knowledge of the distribution of \textit{T. melanosporum} in space among ectomycorrhizal (ECM) host species and in time.
	Molecular identification of hosts (Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism) and fungi (Internal Transcribed Spacer sequencing) and quantification of T. melanosporum mycelium (quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction) were employed to evaluate the presence of T. melanosporum on four dominant ECM host species (\textit{Quercus ilex}, \textit{Quercus coccifera}, \textit{Arbutus unedo}, \textit{Cistus albidus}) and the extent to which their respective ECM communities shared fungal diversity, over the course of development of truffle grounds, from recent unproductive brûlés to senescent ones where production has stopped.
	We found that truffle grounds host rich communities in which multi-host fungal species dominate in frequency. When considering both ECM tips and soil mycelia, we documented a dynamic and spatially heterogeneous pattern of T. melanosporum distribution in soils and a presence of ECM tips restricted to \textit{Q. ilex} roots.
	This study advances our knowledge of the ecology of \textit{T. melanosporum}, and provides insight into the extent of ECM fungal sharing among plant species that dominate Mediterranean landscapes.},

  doi = {10.3389/fpls.2015.00881},
  abstract = {The ectomycorrhizal (ECM) symbiosis connects mutualistic plants and fungal species into bipartite networks. While links between one focal ECM plant and its fungal symbionts have been widely documented, systemic views of ECM networks are lacking, in particular, concerning the ability of fungal species to mediate indirect ecological interactions between ECM plant species (projected-ECM networks). We assembled a large dataset of plant–fungi associations at the species level and at the scale of Corsica using molecular data and unambiguously host-assigned records to: (i) examine the correlation between the number of fungal symbionts of a plant species and the average specialization of these fungal species, (ii) explore the structure of the plant–plant projected network and (iii) compare plant association patterns in regard to their position along the ecological succession. Our analysis reveals no trade-off between specialization of plants and specialization of their partners and a saturation of the plant projected network. Moreover, there is a significantly lower-than-expected sharing of partners between early- and late-successional plant species, with fewer fungal partners for early-successional ones and similar average specialization of symbionts of early- and late-successional plants. Our work paves the way for ecological readings of Mediterranean landscapes that include the astonishing diversity of below-ground interactions.},

  abstract = {1.Characterizing the ecological processes driving the assembly and functional composition of ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungal communities is an area of active research.

	2.Here, we applied a trait-based framework to address whether and how environmental filtering and niche differentiation influence the diversity of ECM fungal enzymatic activities in two oak-dominated forest ecosystems. We hypothesized that fungal enzymatic activities and ECM community assembly are influenced by the availability of targeted resources in the surrounding soil.

	3.We pinpointed a major influence of environmental filtering on ECM fungal taxonomic and functional composition. Contrasted taxonomic composition among forest ecosystems was linked to broad interspecific trait variation and entailed contrasted functional responses at community-level. However, intraspecific trait variation contributed to community response within ecosystems. We characterized a strong relationship between enzymatic activities and targeted resource availability in surrounding soil, suggesting a functional role of the enzymes for the acquisition of these resources. Conversely, we did not find a significant influence of niche differentiation in ECM community assembly.

  abstract = {Community ecologists are active in describing species by their functional traits, quantifying the functional structure of plant and animal assemblages and inferring community assembly processes with null-model analyses of trait distribution and functional diversity indices. Intraspecific variation in traits and effects of spatial scale are potentially important in these analyses. Here, we introduce the R package cati (Community Assembly by Traits: Individuals and beyond) available on CRAN, for the analysis of community assembly with functional traits. cati builds on a recent approach to community assembly that explicitly incorporates individual differences in community assembly analyses and decomposes phenotypic variations across scales and organizational levels, based on three phenotypic variance ratios, termed the T-statistics. More generally, the cati package 1) calculates a variety of single-trait and multi-trait indices from interspecific and intraspecific trait measures; 2) it partitions functional trait variation among spatial and taxonomic levels; 3) it implements a palette of flexible null models for detecting non-random patterns of functional traits. These patterns can be used to draw inferences about hypotheses of community assembly such as environmental filtering and species interactions. The basic input for cati is a data frame in which columns are traits, rows are species or individuals, and entries are the measured trait values. The cati package can also incorporate a square distance matrix into analyses, which could include phylogenetic or genetic distances among individuals or species. Users select from a variety of functional trait metrics and analyze these relative to a null model that specifies trait distributions in a regional source pool.},

  abstract = {Recent studies have shown that accounting for intraspecific trait variation (ITV) may better address major questions in community ecology. However, a general picture of the relative extent of ITV compared to interspecific trait variation in plant communities is still missing. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis of the relative extent of ITV within and among plant communities worldwide, using a data set encompassing 629 communities (plots) and 36 functional traits. Overall, ITV accounted for 25\% of the total trait variation within communities and 32\% of the total trait variation among communities on average. The relative extent of ITV tended to be greater for whole-plant (e.g. plant height) vs. organ-level traits and for leaf chemical (e.g. leaf N and P concentration) vs. leaf morphological (e.g. leaf area and thickness) traits. The relative amount of ITV decreased with increasing species richness and spatial extent, but did not vary with plant growth form or climate. These results highlight global patterns in the relative importance of ITV in plant communities, providing practical guidelines for when researchers should include ITV in trait-based community and ecosystem studies.},

  abstract = {Ectomycorrhizal networks may facilitate the establishment and survival of seedlings regenerating under the canopies of tropical forests and are often invoked as a potential contributor to monodominance. We identified ectomycorrhizal fungi in a monodominant \textit{Gilbertiodendron} dewevrei (Fabaceae) rain forest in Cameroon, using sporocarps and ectomycorrhizae of three age categories (seedlings, intermediate trees, and large trees) and tentatively revealed nutrient transfer through ectomycorrhizal networks by measuring spontaneous isotopic (13C and 15N) abundances in seedlings. Sporocarp surveys revealed fewer ectomycorrhizal fungal taxa (59 species from 1030 sporocarps) than molecular barcoding of ectomycorrhizal roots (75 operational taxonomic units from 828 ectomycorrhizae). Our observations suggest that ectomycorrhizal fungal diversity is similar to that in other mixed tropical forests and provide the first report of the Tuber-Helvella lineage in a tropical forest. Despite some differences, all age categories of G.~dewevrei had overlapping ectomycorrhizal fungal communities, with families belonging to Thelephoraceae, Russulaceae, Sebacinaceae, Boletaceae, and Clavulinaceae. Of the 49 operational taxonomic units shared by the three age categories (65.3\% of the ectomycorrhizal fungal community), 19 were the most abundant on root tips of all categories (38.7\% of the shared taxa), supporting the likelihood of ectomycorrhizal networks. However, we obtained no evidence for nutrient transfer from trees to seedlings. We discuss the composition of the ectomycorrhizal fungal community among the \textit{G.~dewevrei} age categories and the possible role of common ectomycorrhizal networks in this rain forest.},

  abstract = {Millions of hectares of ectomycorrhizal (ECM) forests provide most of the wood resource in the northern hemisphere. Among these forests, those that are fire-prone concentrate an astonishing diversity of mutualistic soil fungi that are pivotal for seedling establishment, tree growth and forest functioning and dynamics. Here, we review the effects of fire on ECM symbiosis in these forests using a systematic screening of the literature. We reveal that a low number of field studies (73) directly address fire effect on ECM symbiosis, in a restricted geographic area that partially represents the geography of ECM biodiversity stakes and fire risk. The analyzed literature consensually reports long-term shifts in the composition of ECM fungal communities after fire. Contrastingly, the effects of fire on fungal diversity and richness at the local scale continue to be debated among researchers, and need to be documented further using adequate experimental device to limit the effects of some identified methodological biases. Furthermore, our analysis emphasizes the urgent need to carefully consider the belowground effects of prescribed burning. This is an important conclusion because this widely implemented and efficient management tool to prevent wildfires may impact ECM soil communities in the same way as uncontrolled events. Our analysis finally highlights the need of refining the concept of post-fire ECM fungi, by taking advantage of promising tools, such as next-generation sequencing and quantitative PCR applied to mycelia and spores, to integrate the vegetative traits of fungi in integrative definitions.},

We analyzed the fruiting patterns of a rare but widely distributed saproxylic macromycete, \textit{Xylobolus subpileatus}, during the ageing of natural canopy gaps in oak forests. In one of the last remaining \textit{Quercus ilex} old-growth forests (on the island of Corsica, western Mediterranean basin), we systematically recorded and conducted molecular analyses of \textit{X. subpileatus} basidiomes in 80 dated natural canopy gaps representing a 45 year-long sequence of residence time of tree logs on the forest floor. \textit{X. subpileatus} fruited exclusively on \textit{Q. ilex} logs. The probability of fruiting of \textit{X. subpileatus} significantly increases during the process of wood decomposition to reach its maximum in the oldest gaps, ca. 40 years after treefall. In contrast, the abundance and the richness of saprobic and ectomycorrhizal fruitbodies decrease as canopy gaps age. Our results emphasize the high ecological specialization of \textit{X. subpileatus}. They also highlight the imperative need to conserve the last patches of old-growth Mediterranean forests to secure the persistence of endangered and functionally unique macromycetes whose presence is highly dependent on old wood in advanced stages of decomposition.},

  abstract = {Abstract We introduce the R package ecolottery dedicated to quick and efficient simulation of communities undergoing local neutral dynamics with environmentally filtered immigration from a reference species pool (spatially implicit model). The package includes an Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) tool to estimate the parameters of these processes. We present the rationale of the approach and show examples of simulations and ABC analysis. The species in the reference pool differ in their abundances and trait values. Environmental filtering weights the probability of immigration success depending on trait values, while the descendants of established immigrants undergo neutral stochastic drift. The reference pool can be defined in a flexible way as representing, e.g. the composition of a broad biogeographical region, or available dispersers around local communities. The package provides a process-based alternative to the use of randomization-based null models. The package proposes a coalescent-based simulation algorithm that presents significant advantages over alternative algorithms. It does not require simulating community dynamics from an initial state forward in time but does still allow measurement of the influence of environmental filtering. Because of its high calculation speed, this approach allows simulating many communities within a reasonable amount of time. Diverse patterns of taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic compositions can be generated. The package can be used to explore the outcome of ecological and evolutionary processes playing at local and regional scales, and to estimate the parameters of these processes based on observed patterns.},
